Feature: Login with facebook

  As a user
  So that I can use the site to get a personal assistant,
  I want to login with facebook credentials

  Scenario: click on login button
    Given This feature is pending due to testing of external site (Facebook's Oauth)
    #Given I am on the home page
    #Wdjflkjen I follow "fb_button"
    #Then I should be on the user page
